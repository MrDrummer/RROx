# RailroadsOnline Extended

## Antivirus warning

RROx needs to inject code into the game to function. However, this is not something regular programs do, and as such, it might get detected by your antivirus.

If necessary, you can add an exception to your antivirus for the following folder: `%localappdata%\RailroadsOnlineExtended`

All of the code is open-source, such that it can be verified by others to make sure it does not contain any malicious code. The executable that will most likely be detected by the antivirus is the injector. This injector is built using Cheat Engine, which is also open-source and can be found here: [https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine)

## How to use

Watch the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vvz0CANFxD0) that shows the basic usage of RROx. In addition, the Info tab gives more a more detailed explanation of how to use it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Attaching fails**: When attaching fails, make sure that the game is running and that you have added an exception to your antivirus as indicated in the antivirus warning. If attaching still fails after adding the exception, you could try to reinstall RROx by running the downloaded setup file again. Your antivirus might have removed necessary files before you added the exception, and reinstalling will make sure these files are recreated.
