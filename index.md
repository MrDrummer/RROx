# RailroadsOnline Extended

### How to download

You can find the latest release of RROx [here](https://github.com/tom-90/RROx/releases/latest). Under assets, download the file `RailroadsOnline.Extended.Setup.exe` and run it to install RROx.

### Antivirus warning

RROx needs to inject code into the game to function. However, this is not something regular programs do, and as such, it might get detected by your antivirus.

If necessary, you can add an exception to your antivirus for the following folder: `%localappdata%\RailroadsOnlineExtended`

All of the code is open-source, such that it can be verified by others to make sure it does not contain any malicious code. The executable that will most likely be detected by the antivirus is the injector. This injector is built using Cheat Engine, which is also open-source and can be found here: https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine
